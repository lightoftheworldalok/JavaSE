Pipes in Java IO provides the ability for two threads running in the same JVM to communicate. Therefore pipes can also be sources or destinations of data.
You cannot use a pipe to communicate with a thread in a different JVM (different process). The pipe concept in Java is different from the pipe concept in Unix / Linux, 
where two processes running in different address spaces can communicate via a pipe. In Java, 
the communicating parties must be running in the same process, and should be different threads.
