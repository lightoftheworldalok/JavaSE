 * PrintStream --> Output stream that contains print() and println()
 * PushbackInputStream --> Input stream that allows bytes to be returned to the stream
 * SequenceInputStream --> Input stream that is a combination of two or more input stream that will be read sequentially, one after the other
 * 
 * CharacterStream Classes
 * 
 * BufferedReader --> Buffered input character stream
